Hi! I’m guessing you found this page because I left a comment on one of your fanfics. I know that most of you have probably spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours writing these stories, and I recognize that what we are asking is no small favor. In order to hopefully put your mind at ease, I've shared more information about myself, the other researchers, and the project here:

**My background and motivation**

I have a M.A. in Literary and Cultural Studies, and I'm interested in studying retold stories through the lenses of formalism, genre studies, reception studies, and digital humanities. In my “digital humanities” research, I use math and computer science (but **not** generative AI) to analyze broad trends in literature and culture. <span style="background-color: lightcoral;">I am particularly interested in applying computational tools to study fanfiction and fan communities.</span> Through such tools, I’ve been able to look at thousands of fanfics and calculate things like what their most frequently used words were or how often they used certain rhetorical devices. Obviously, though, fanfics are much more nuanced than simple word counts could reveal, and I would like to develop more advanced tools that could be used to study fanfiction (or literature more broadly), focusing particularly on calculating story similarity.

**This project**

<span style="background-color: lightcoral;">In order to develop good tools, we first need a collection of fanfics to use as a test set.</span> That way, after we say something like “calculating the ratio of happy to sad words in every chapter can reveal the emotional arc of a story” we can go look at a group of fanfics and see if that actually holds true for them. We were particularly interested in including your fanfics in our test set because you tag your stories really well and because they feature substantial plots. 

**How your stories would be included in our paper**

If we publish a paper about our research project, we might mention some of your stories in the paper, to this effect: “Computational method XYZ was particularly good at identifying similar plots between stories that otherwise have drastically different settings. For example, it identified that fanfic #14 and fanfic #37 are both murder mysteries even though fanfic #14 is based on a police procedural set in Hawaii, and fanfic #37 is based on a detective series set in Victorian England.”

We are also planning to include the test set alongside our paper. This would allow other researchers to a) know that we weren’t just making up claims about the computational methods we were testing and b) potentially build upon our research and find better computational methods. The test set would include the texts of the fanfics and some of their metadata (e.g. story tags), alongside measurements for how similar we think pairs of stories are within certain categories (e.g. fanfics #14 and #37 have plots that are 90% similar, settings that are 30% similar, etc.). We would replace fanfic titles and AO3 pseudonyms with numerical IDs to protect author identity. In order to access the test set, people will have to confirm that <span style="background-color: lightcoral;">they are not going to use the stories to train AI models</span>.

**Who else is working on this project**

I'm working on this project with [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/) and [Amanda Bertsch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abertsch/).
Emma is a professor at CMU whose two main research focuses are a) how machine learning tools can be made actually useful to non-computer scientists and b) the environmental impact of AI. Thanks to them, I now feel guilty every time I use Chat GPT instead of a thesaurus lol. 
Amanda's is a PhD student at CMU and an organizer for [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/). Her research interests include long-context embeddings (i.e. how long texts can be represented computationally) and responsible dataset construction (I particularly like [this paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.gebnlp-1.24.pdf) she wrote about how ML models learn gender biases from the data they are trained on).
