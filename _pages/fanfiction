Hi! I’m guessing you’ve found this page because I left a comments on one of your fanfics. I know that most of you have probably spent hundreds (if not thousands) of hours writing these stories, and I recognize that I am asking a very large favor from you. In order to hopefully put your mind at ease, I've shared more information about myself and the project down below.

My background and motivation
I’m a “digital humanities” researcher, which means I use math and computer science (but **not** generative AI) to analyze broad trends in literature and culture. Fan studies is one of my main areas of focus. 

What this project really entails
Through computational tools, I’ve been able to look at thousands of fanfics and calculate things like what their most frequently used words were or how often they used certain rhetorical devices. Obviously, though, fanfics are much more nuanced than simple word counts could reveal, and I would like to develop more advanced tools that could be used to study fanfiction (or literature more broadly), focusing particularly on calculating story similarity.
In order to develop good tools, I first need a collection of fanfics to use as a test set. That way, after I say something like “calculating the ratio of happy to sad words in every chapter can reveal the emotional arc of a story” I can go look at a group of fanfics and see if that actually holds true for them. We were particularly interested in including your fanfics in our test set because you tag your stories really well and because they feature substantial plots. If we publish a paper about our research project, we might mention some of your stories in the paper, to this effect: “Computational method XYZ was particularly good at identifying similar plots between stories that otherwise have drastically different settings. For example, it identified that fanfic #14 and fanfic #37 are both murder mysteries even though fanfic #14 is based on a police procedural set in Hawaii, and fanfic #37 is based on a detective series set in Victorian England.”

How your stories would be included in our paper
We are planning to include the test set alongside our paper. This would allow other researchers to a) know that we weren’t just making up claims about the computational methods we were testing and b) potentially build upon our research and find better computational methods. The test set would include the texts of the fanfics and some of their metadata (e.g. story tags), alongside measurements for how similar we think pairs of stories are within certain categories (e.g. fanfics #14 and #37 have plots that are 90% similar, settings that are 30% similar, etc.). We would replace fanfic titles and AO3 pseudonyms with numerical IDs to protect author identity. In order to access the test set, people will have to confirm that they are not going to use the stories to train AI models.

Who else is working on this project
I'm working on this project with Emma Strubell and Amanda Bertsch, a professor and phd student I met at Carnegie Mellon University. Though it can be very scary to let CS people anywhere near your creative material, I want to assure you that these are really cool (and ethical) CS people.
Emma's main research focuses are a) how machine learning tools can be made actually useful to non-computer scientists and b) the environmental impact of AI. Thanks to them, I feel guilty every time I use Chat GPT instead of a thesaurus lol
Amanda researches a lot of very technical things that I don't fu
Though this project does have a somewhat computational focus, I want to assure you that I am not just a CS person who sees fanfiction as free data. I have been a very genuine participant in fan culture since my teenage years, and I want to develop tools to study fanfiction because I see it as an invaluable part of literature and culture that deserves to be recognized in academia.
