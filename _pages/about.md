Nice to meet you :) I am a researcher interested in the computational analysis of narrative media and digital culture.

I received a B.S. in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, with a concentration in Computational Methods for Literary and Cultural Analytics. My undergraduate honors thesis applied NLP and social network analysis to explore the role of inter-authorial influence within fanfiction communities. Subsequently, I pursued an M.A. in Literary and Cultural Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where I designed my own concentration in Cultural Analytics.

As a Research Scientist at Graphika, I develop machine learning models to capture the structure, interests, and evolution of online communities. I am also currently a Visiting Researcher at CMU's Language Technology Institute, where I am studying long-context embeddings for literary applications.
