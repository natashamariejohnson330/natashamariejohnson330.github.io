    Outside of research, I enjoy training my miniature poodle Vanilla, dabbling in artistic pursuits, and exploring the outdoors. I've mostly stuck to physical activities that involve stiff boots--such as hiking and snowboarding--after an escapade with the [Stanford Climbing Team](https://www.instagram.com/stanfordclimbingteam/) resulted in a permanently broken foot (which *apparently* doesn't even make you eligible for the paralympics). When I'm too lazy to venture outside, I compose [music](https://youtu.be/KSsZinwyk3U) and practice [visual art](assets/img/drawing.jpg).

Nice to meet you :) I am a researcher interested in the computational analysis of narrative media and its digital afterlife.

I am fascinated by storytelling genres with communal and derivative elements such as fanfiction, mythological retellings, and genre fiction, and I'm curious about the ways internet communities participate in this collective storytelling. My humanistic inquiry is situated within critical frameworks such as reception studies, formalism, and digital humanities. My computational interests, which are informed by my work in digital humanities and cultural analytics, involve developing and evaluating NLP and network science model for research in these fields.

I received a B.S. in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, with a concentration in Computational Methods for Literary and Cultural Analytics. Througout undergrad, I worked as a Research Assistant for the [Stanford Literary Lab](https://litlab.stanford.edu/) under [Mark Algee-Hewitt](http://markalgeehewitt.org/). My undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Algee-Hewitt and [Daniel Jurafsky](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/), applied NLP and social network analysis to explore the role of inter-authorial influence within fanfiction communities. Subsequently, I pursued an M.A. in Literary and Cultural Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where I designed my own concentration in Cultural Analytics.

As a Research Scientist at Graphika, I develop machine learning models to capture the structure, interests, and evolution of online communities. I am also currently a Visiting Researcher at CMU's Language Technology Institute (working with [Emma Strubell](https://strubell.github.io/) and [Amanda Bertsch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abertsch/)), where I am studying long-context embeddings for literary applications.
